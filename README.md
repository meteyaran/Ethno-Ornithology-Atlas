## 🦅 Abstract & Vision

**Ethno-Ornithology Atlas** is not merely a biological database; it is a digital inquiry into the relationship between human language and avian nature. Developed from a sociological perspective, this project explores how we name, perceive, and mimic the natural world.

The platform serves two primary functions:
1.  **A Visual & Sonic Archive:** Documenting global bird species through AI-generated conceptual art and bioacoustics.
2.  **Cultural Preservation:** Deciphering the **Whistled Language of Kuşköy (Giresun)**—a unique linguistic phenomenon where human speech transforms into bird-like whistles to traverse deep valleys.

## 🗺️ Features

### 1. The Living Lexicon (A-Z World Birds)
An interactive archive where birds are treated as fluid symbols.
* **AI-Generated Concept Art:** Each species is visualized not just anatomically, but conceptually, reflecting their "impression" on the human mind.
* **Taxonomy & Habitat:** Scientific classification and dynamic range maps.
* **Bioacoustics Player:** High-fidelity recordings of calls and songs.

### 2. The Whistle Decoder (Kuş Dili / Giresun)
A specialized Machine Learning module dedicated to the **UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage: Whistled Turkish**.
* **Whistle-to-Text Translation:** An NLP model trained to recognize the tonal variations of the "Bird Language" used in the Northern Turkish mountains and translate them into standard text.
* **Anthropological Context:** A deep-dive section on the sociology of distance communication and the history of the Kuşköy community.

### 3. Avian Identification (ML)
* **Real-time Recognition:** A neural network that identifies bird species from user-uploaded audio samples, bridging the gap between nature and digital recognition.

### 4. Geospatial Distribution
* **Global Mapping:** An interactive map visualizing the distribution of species and the specific geographical isolation that gave birth to the Whistled Language in the Black Sea region.
